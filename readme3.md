# Task 3: Predicting Customer Churn (Classification)

## Objective
Build a classification model to predict whether a customer will churn using Logistic Regression.

## Steps
1. Preprocessing: Clean data and encode categorical variables (One-Hot or Label Encoding).  
2. Train-Test Split: Divide the dataset into training and test sets.  
3. Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression classifier.  
4. Evaluation: Use Accuracy and Confusion Matrix to assess performance.  

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle).  

## Expected Output
- Clean preprocessing steps.  
- Logistic Regression model.  
- Accuracy score printed.  
- Confusion Matrix + explanation of results.
