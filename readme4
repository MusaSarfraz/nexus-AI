# Task 4: Optimizing Churn Prediction (Advanced Classification)

## Objective
Improve churn prediction using advanced models and evaluation metrics.

## Steps
1. Feature Scaling: Apply StandardScaler to numerical features.  
2. Model Training: Train Random Forest or XGBoost classifier.  
3. Advanced Evaluation: Calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
4. Comparison: Compare results with Logistic Regression (Task 3) and justify the better model.  

## Dataset
Same Telco Customer Churn dataset.  

## Expected Output
- Advanced model (Random Forest or XGBoost).  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score printed.  
- Comparison table vs Logistic Regression.  
- Recommendation of which model is better for deployment.
